Now you're telling me
you're a machine.

3
00:00:07,014 --> 00:00:08,003
The robot.

4
00:00:08,082 --> 00:00:11,017
You knew I wanted access
to the defense mainframe.



5
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:14,452
Do you have any idea what they
will do to me if they find out?

6
00:00:14,522 --> 00:00:15,784
Get down.



7
00:00:16,991 --> 00:00:19,425
<i>(Adama) Moments ago,
this ship received word...</i>

8
00:00:19,494 --> 00:00:22,952
<i>of a Cylon attack against
our home worlds is underway.</i>

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,124
As of this moment,
we are at war.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,259
All right,
we can take three more people.

11
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:30,397
Giving up my seat.

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,802
I've decided you're an expression
of my subconscious mind...

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,314

during my waking states.

14
00:00:41,382 --> 00:00:43,942
So I'm only in your head?

15
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:48,345
No.

16
00:00:48,422 --> 00:00:50,982
There maybe Cylon agents
living among us.

17
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:53,390
Some may not even know
they're Cylons at all.

18

<i>They could be
sleeper agents...</i>

19

Are you even listening to me?

You have to

36
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:13,862
I believe in a world
that I can and do understand.

37
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:17,665
A rational universe explained
through rational means.

No, but you're not rational.

48
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:07,585
Pilot says they've had to
reboot the FTL computer again.

49
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:14,085
(Cally) Why do the Cylons
come every 33 minutes?

50

Why isn't it 34, 35...

51

Cally.

Shut up.

Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

70
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,622
<i>I'm afraid the Cylons
have appeared again.</i>

00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:22,753
<i>However, our FTL drive is now
working and we will jump momentarily.</i>

72

Five days now.

73
00:05:30,805 --> 00:05:32,534
There are limits...

74
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,740
to the human body,
the human mind.

75
00:05:36,677 --> 00:05:39,271
Tolerances
that you can't push beyond.

76
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:43,677
Those are facts...

77
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:46,576
provable facts.

78

Everyone has their limit.

And let's start prepping
for the next jump.

No, of course not.

110
00:08:05,426 --> 00:08:07,826
The Cylons
will follow us again...

111
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:11,558
as they have
the last 237 times.

112
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:17,332
You're right, you know.
There are limits.

Eventually,
you'll make a mistake.

114

Yes.

116

Divide the fleet
into six groups.

[Adama sighs]

124
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:23,056
Then they jump two more times and on
the fourth jump, we rendezvous at...

00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:25,256
a common set of coordinates.

126
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:30,669

Not anymore.

(Apollo) Combat landings expected
again to be the order of the day...

132
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,355
so double-check
your undercarriage before...

133
00:10:55,728 --> 00:10:59,095
Look, you've all done this
237 times.

134
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:02,830
You know what to do.

135
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,169
No mistakes.

136
00:11:06,072 --> 00:11:08,063
And let's make it to 238.

137

You got it, Chief.

141
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:42,772
No, Cally, there's three.
I know there's three.

142
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:44,434
Can you check it again
for me, please?

143
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,534
Yeah.

144
00:11:45,611 --> 00:11:48,273
At least get some of them
starting to work.

145
00:11:48,714 --> 00:11:50,614
We'll sleep when we're dead.
Come on.

Primary fuel 2893 KRG.

151
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,189
Marine told one of the pilots that
we marooned some guy back on Ragnar...

152
00:12:04,263 --> 00:12:06,424
because they actually thought
that he was a Cylon.

153

You know what?
I don't give a frak.

See if it's blocked.

156
00:12:14,507 --> 00:12:15,667
Right.

157
00:12:16,142 --> 00:12:17,302
Right.

158
00:12:30,823 --> 00:12:33,155
A little rough on your
new ECO, don't you think?

159
00:12:33,226 --> 00:12:34,818
He's not my ECO.

160
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:39,694
He's some refugee from Triton that I've
been saddled with and I didn't ask you.

161
00:12:44,036 --> 00:12:45,469
Helo's gone, Sharon.

162
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:47,768
I didn't ask you that, either.

00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:53,805
Sorry.

How many have you got?

00:13:01,087 --> 00:13:04,250
5,251 survivors
from Saggitaron, last count.

We can't transmit photos yet. If you
want, you can leave them with us...

168

or you can put them
on the board outside.

169
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:14,359
Sorry.

170
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:16,161
Thanks.

Update on the headcount,

How did we lose 300?

175
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:24,164
There were some overcounts...

176
00:14:24,837 --> 00:14:29,103
a few deaths from wounds and a
few missing during the last attack.

177
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,607
Do you want children, Gaius?

178
00:15:13,552 --> 00:15:16,077
Let me think about that
for a minute.

179
00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:18,380
No.

Procreation
is one of God's commandments.

181

Really?

182
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,335
I'm sure someday, if you're a
good Cylon, he'll reward you...

toaster of your very own.

184
00:15:34,173 --> 00:15:37,108
I want us
to have a child, Gaius.

185
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,872
You can't be serious.

186
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,144
It's Dr. Amarak.

187
00:15:41,213 --> 00:15:42,703
What was that?

188
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:53,290
I'm so sorry for interrupting
you while you were speaking.

189
00:15:53,726 --> 00:15:55,523
You were just saying?

[mutters]

191
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,827
I was just saying
that a Dr. Amarak...

192
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:03,064
had requested
to speak with the President.

193
00:16:03,135 --> 00:16:04,796
Dr. Amarak. I see.

194
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:07,336
You know him?

195
00:16:07,406 --> 00:16:09,738
Have you always been able
to multitask like this?

196
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:11,071
Yes. Yes.

197
00:16:12,044 --> 00:16:15,309
I used to work with him
at the Ministry of Defense.

198
00:16:16,048 --> 00:16:19,745
It says here that he's uncovered
important information...

199
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:23,482
regarding how the Cylons were
able to defeat colonial defenses.

200
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:25,615
I was always a little worried
he was on to us.

201
00:16:25,691 --> 00:16:27,522
Were you going
to speak to him?

202
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:30,528
Perhaps I should speak to him
if you're busy.

203
00:16:31,097 --> 00:16:34,726
Actually, I think he wanted to
speak directly with the President.

204
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,461
It sounded urgent.

205
00:16:37,636 --> 00:16:39,661
It must be very important.

206
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,942
Maybe something about a certain
traitor in the President's inner circle?

207
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,671
There's not enough time
before we jump.

208
00:16:46,745 --> 00:16:50,112
I want him on board first
thing during the next cycle.

209
00:16:50,516 --> 00:16:52,177
Thank you, Doctor.

210
00:16:55,087 --> 00:16:57,317
I'd say you have
a serious problem.

211
00:16:57,389 --> 00:16:58,879
If I can help.

212
00:17:05,364 --> 00:17:07,559

Twelve more cases of nervous
exhaustion. That makes 61.

224
00:18:54,906 --> 00:18:58,364
Have the docs start pumpin'
them up with stimulants...

225
00:18:58,576 --> 00:19:00,203

Yours. I took 10 last time.

237
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:26,028
I'll see you guys in combat.

238
00:19:26,237 --> 00:19:27,966

You're the CAG, act like one.

What the hell does that mean?

It means that you're still acting

Our job isn't to be careful, it's to

"Good hunting"

So she either says, "Yes, sir"...

258

you smack her in the mouth...

259

Did you or didn't you?

286

They're not logged in, sir. I think
they may have been left behind.

How many people aboard ship?

288
00:22:50,942 --> 00:22:54,309
1,345 souls, sir.

289
00:22:56,614 --> 00:23:01,051

It may not have been
her fault, sir.

291
00:23:03,287 --> 00:23:05,312
It may have simply been
a navigational error...

292
00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:07,220
and they jumped
to the wrong coordinates...

293
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,384
or the Cylons destroyed the
ship before they jumped...

294
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,155
Or 50 other things
may have happened.

295

what the hell did happen.

Yes, we're tired.
Yes, there's no relief.

It's part of the pattern,

Dr. Amarak
posed a threat to you.

321

Now he's gone. Logic says
there's a connection.

322

A connection, maybe.
But not God.

355
00:28:16,266 --> 00:28:19,963
You're right and I defer to
your decision. And, Commander...

356
00:28:21,771 --> 00:28:23,762
<i>let your men and women...</i>

357
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:29,837
<i>know how grateful I am for the
job that they are doing, please.</i>

358
00:28:32,081 --> 00:28:33,742
Thank them for me.

359
00:28:35,084 --> 00:28:37,177
<i>Thank you, Madam President.</i>

360
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,651
Thank you.

361
00:28:43,893 --> 00:28:45,417
Contact Apollo.

362
00:28:46,062 --> 00:28:49,327
Tell him to set up a combat
patrol around the fleet...

363
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:52,459
and order his other pilots
to land immediately.

364
00:28:52,735 --> 00:28:54,794
All right, people,
you heard the order.

365
00:28:54,871 --> 00:28:59,137
Boomer, Starbuck, form up with
me. We'll fly the first CAP.

366
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:03,370
<i>I want everyone else back on
Galactica and in their racks.</i>

367
00:29:03,646 --> 00:29:05,409
<i>Three-hour rotation.</i>

368
00:29:05,682 --> 00:29:06,944
<i>(Starbuck)
Hey, Apollo...</i>

369
00:29:07,016 --> 00:29:09,746
not that I'm not honored by being
chosen to sit in my cockpit...

370
00:29:09,819 --> 00:29:11,446
for the next three hours but...

371
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:12,920
But why you?

372
00:29:14,123 --> 00:29:15,590
Take a guess.

373
00:29:15,892 --> 00:29:17,689
<i>Because I'm on drugs?</i>

374
00:29:18,261 --> 00:29:20,525
You got it. This patrol
is 100% stimulated.

375

<i>[Starbuck laughing]</i>

376

<i>(Apollo)
How about you, Boomer?</i>

379
00:29:29,005 --> 00:29:32,065

better than anybody in the squadron.

380
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:33,904
(Boomer)
I'm tired like everybody else.

381
00:29:33,977 --> 00:29:35,171
<i>You never seem it.</i>

382
00:29:35,245 --> 00:29:36,906
<i>(Starbuck)
That's 'cause she's a Cylon.</i>

383
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,608
You're going to make me come
over there and kick your ass.

384
00:29:39,682 --> 00:29:42,674
Okay. Let's set up
a patrol here...

385
00:29:42,752 --> 00:29:44,777
before somebody gets hurt.

386
00:29:45,722 --> 00:29:46,814
Follow me.

387
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,017
<i>(Starbuck)
Copy that, Apollo.</i>

388
00:29:55,765 --> 00:29:59,223
A couple hours rack time
does sound awfully sweet...

389
00:29:59,302 --> 00:30:00,360
right about now.

390
00:30:00,436 --> 00:30:01,994
You deserve it.

391
00:30:03,973 --> 00:30:06,134
You know, the truth is...

392
00:30:07,944 --> 00:30:12,005
all this has me feeling more
alive than I have in years.

393
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,745
You look that way, too.

394
00:30:15,818 --> 00:30:18,343
It's good to see you
without the cup in your hand.

395
00:30:18,454 --> 00:30:19,648
Don't start.

396
00:30:19,722 --> 00:30:22,885
I know there's a whole lot
of people aboard this ship...

397
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:25,689
that wish you weren't feeling
as good as you are.

398
00:30:25,762 --> 00:30:29,027
If the crew doesn't hate the
XO, then he's not doin' his job.

399
00:30:29,098 --> 00:30:32,090
Besides, got to make
the old man look good.

400
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:34,498
I always look good.

401
00:30:34,971 --> 00:30:36,939
Did you look in a mirror?

402
00:30:37,006 --> 00:30:37,995
Seriously...

403
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:39,132
Sir.

404
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:42,507
...it's one thing to push the
crew, it's another to break them.

410
00:30:53,923 --> 00:30:55,288

Put the fleet
into Condition One.

416
00:31:16,245 --> 00:31:19,612
I want all Vipers manned and
ready, but keep them in the tubes.

No. It's all wrong.

426
00:31:40,603 --> 00:31:43,663
If they were left behind, why
didn't the Cylons destroy them?

427
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,238
And why are they
showing up now?

428
00:31:46,376 --> 00:31:49,402
It's God's punishment
for your lack of faith.

429
00:31:50,246 --> 00:31:52,339
That's just great, that is.

430
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:55,984
A more logical and useful
explanation, please.

431
00:31:56,886 --> 00:31:58,217
All right.

Logically, in order

437
00:32:21,344 --> 00:32:24,040

any more than that.</i>

462
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:27,036
Madam President,
I strongly recommend...

463
00:33:27,109 --> 00:33:30,738
that we cut off all wireless
communication with that ship right away.

464
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:32,144

Why?

465

Look, forgive me for being
rude, but wake up, all right?

466
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,548
<i>The only reason the Olympic
Carrier is still flying...</i>

467
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,588
is because the Cylons
let them survive.

468

They've been
tracking that ship all along.

469
00:33:41,557 --> 00:33:43,684
There's probably a Cylon
agent aboard right now!

470
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:44,817
Calm down.

471
00:33:45,461 --> 00:33:46,826
Start over.

472
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:51,122
Please, Madam President,
I implore you. Listen to me.

473
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,759
Cut off radio communication
with that ship...

474
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:56,964
before they send via broadcast
signal another computer virus...

475
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,406

before they blow us all up.

476

Com. Adama,
are you on the line?

477
00:34:05,247 --> 00:34:08,239
Cut off the speakers.
Put it through the line.

478
00:34:08,851 --> 00:34:12,753
Yes, Madam President. And I'm
inclined to agree with Dr. Baltar.

I suggest that we evacuate the
passengers and destroy the ship.

[alarm sounds]

524
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:57,246
Radiological alarm!

525
00:36:57,653 --> 00:36:59,086
Radiological alarm!

526
00:36:59,154 --> 00:37:00,519
From where?

527
00:37:02,157 --> 00:37:04,955
<i>The Olympic Carrier, sir.
They've got nukes on board.</i>

528
00:37:05,027 --> 00:37:09,726
<i>Madam President, we have to eliminate
the Olympic Carrier immediately.</i>

529
00:37:10,232 --> 00:37:12,996
There are 1,300 people
on that ship.

530
00:37:13,402 --> 00:37:14,562
<i>(Adama)
We don't know that.</i>

531
00:37:14,636 --> 00:37:17,298
<i>The Cylons may have
captured them already.</i>

532
00:37:17,372 --> 00:37:20,500
She's not going to do it.
She has to do it.

533
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:23,401
It's not her decision, Gaius.

534
00:37:23,478 --> 00:37:24,467
No?

535
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,538
It's God's choice.
He wants you to repent.

536
00:37:28,617 --> 00:37:32,576
Look, at this point there's no
choice. It's either them or us.

537
00:37:32,754 --> 00:37:34,517
Repent of your sins.

538
00:37:34,823 --> 00:37:37,656
Accept his true love
and you will be saved.

539
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:46,526
I repent. There, I repent.

540
00:37:50,439 --> 00:37:53,499
I repent.

541
00:37:56,678 --> 00:37:57,838
Do it.

542
00:37:59,948 --> 00:38:02,041
<i>(Boomer)
We have new orders.</i>

543
00:38:02,284 --> 00:38:06,345
<i>We're directed to destroy
the Olympic Carrier...</i>

544
00:38:06,421 --> 00:38:08,389
<i>and return to Galactica.</i>

545
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:11,422
It's a civilian ship.

546
00:38:12,995 --> 00:38:15,725
<i>(Apollo) Yeah, a
civilian ship with nukes.</i>

547
00:38:24,339 --> 00:38:26,864
<i>I don't see anybody in there,
do you?</i>

548
00:38:32,948 --> 00:38:34,916
The Cylons will be here
any second.

549
00:38:34,983 --> 00:38:37,611
If we're going to do this,
let's just do it.

550
00:38:37,686 --> 00:38:39,711
Starbuck, form up with me.

551
00:38:39,788 --> 00:38:42,086
<i>We'll make one pass
from astern.</i>

552
00:38:43,792 --> 00:38:46,317
<i>(Starbuck)
Lee, what if you're wrong?</i>

553
00:38:52,467 --> 00:38:53,934
<i>Lee, come on.</i>

554
00:38:54,569 --> 00:38:55,729
<i>Lee...</i>

555
00:38:58,573 --> 00:39:00,438
Okay, fire on my mark.

556
00:39:01,343 --> 00:39:03,140
No frakking way, Lee.

557
00:39:03,812 --> 00:39:06,303
Lee? Come on!

558
00:39:10,752 --> 00:39:12,014
[beeping]

559
00:39:15,057 --> 00:39:16,149
Mark.

560
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,382
[rain pattering]

561
00:40:04,873 --> 00:40:06,067
[sighs]

562
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:08,899
Are you alive?

563
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:11,173
[panting]

564
00:40:12,714 --> 00:40:14,682
Agathon, Karl C.

565
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,684
Lieutenant, junior grade,
Colonial Fleet.

566
00:40:16,752 --> 00:40:19,687
PK-789-9348.

567
00:40:19,755 --> 00:40:21,689
I know who you are, Helo.

568
00:40:21,757 --> 00:40:23,952
It's all right. I'm a friend.

569
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:33,300
[guns firing]

570
00:40:37,406 --> 00:40:38,634
[groans]

571
00:40:39,007 --> 00:40:40,167
[gags]

572
00:40:44,212 --> 00:40:45,406
Sharon?

573
00:40:50,652 --> 00:40:52,620
What are you doing here?

574
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:54,488
Can you walk?

575
00:40:56,491 --> 00:40:58,686
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I think so.

576
00:40:58,794 --> 00:41:00,022
[grunts]

577
00:41:00,195 --> 00:41:01,719
What are you doing here,
I thought...

578
00:41:01,797 --> 00:41:03,526
Let's move, mister.

579
00:41:29,925 --> 00:41:30,983
Sir.

580
00:41:31,993 --> 00:41:33,051
Son.

581
00:41:46,641 --> 00:41:49,872
I gave the order.
It was my responsibility.

582
00:41:53,448 --> 00:41:55,245
I pulled the trigger.

583
00:41:58,854 --> 00:42:00,253
That's mine.

584
00:42:10,232 --> 00:42:12,132
(Billy)
Madam President?

585
00:42:14,836 --> 00:42:16,428
Madam President?

586
00:42:20,142 --> 00:42:22,667
I'm sorry,
you were saying something?

587
00:42:27,182 --> 00:42:29,377
Twenty-four hours, no Cylons.

588
00:42:30,018 --> 00:42:32,543
At least you know
it was the right choice.

589
00:42:32,621 --> 00:42:34,248
The right choice.

590
00:42:40,495 --> 00:42:43,862
I'm sorry, Billy. I think I'd
like some time alone, please.

591
00:42:43,932 --> 00:42:45,263
Of course.

592
00:42:57,979 --> 00:42:59,344
What is it?

593
00:43:00,982 --> 00:43:02,950
Update on the headcount.

594
00:43:03,218 --> 00:43:04,879
Subtract how many?

595
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,545
Actually, you can add one.

596
00:43:10,091 --> 00:43:13,185
<i>A baby was born this morning
on the Rising Star.</i>

597
00:43:14,629 --> 00:43:15,789
A boy.

598
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:18,025
A baby.

599
00:43:18,867 --> 00:43:19,959
Yeah.

600
00:43:26,808 --> 00:43:28,139
Thank you.
